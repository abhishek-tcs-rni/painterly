# Painterly
Aaron Hertzmann's algorithm for stroke-based rendering in Python. Its only dependencies are OpenCV and NumPy
![Original photo of tomatoes](images/tomato.jpg)
![Painting of the tomato photo](images/tomato_rendered.jpg)

### Usage
See example.ipynb for an example usage from the command-line or by importing.

From the command-line:
```
python painterly.py IMAGE_FILE [--r RADII][--output OUTPUT_FILENAME][--T APPOX_THRESH][--straight][--f_g GRID_FACTOR]
```
example
```
python3 painterly.py images/tomato.jpg --r 8 4 2 --output images/tomato_rendered.jpg
```
where you want to use radii 8, 4, and 2 pixels in that order.
