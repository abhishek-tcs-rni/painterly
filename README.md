# Painterly
Aaron Hertzmann's algorithm for stroke-based rendering in Python. The algorithm paints a given image using curved brush strokes of given widths.  Its only dependencies are OpenCV and NumPy as seen in requirements.txt.

![Painting of the tomato photo](images/tomato_rendered.jpg)

### Usage
See example.ipynb for an example usage from the command-line or by importing.

From the command-line:
```
python painterly.py IMAGE_FILE [--r RADII][--output OUTPUT_FILENAME][--T APPROX_THRESH][--straight][--f_g GRID_FACTOR]
```
example:
```
python3 painterly.py images/tomato.jpg --r 8 4 2 --output images/tomato_rendered.jpg
```
where you want to use radii 8, 4, and 2 pixels in that order.
